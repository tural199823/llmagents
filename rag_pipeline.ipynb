       "* **Generative Art & AI:** This is a prominent theme with several potential talks.  Given the \"🎨🤖 AI & the Soul of Art\" talk, expect discussions around:\n",
       "    * **Meaning & Authorship:**  How does AI create art? Does it truly \"own\" creativity, or is it a collaboration?\n",
       "    * **The Role of the Artist:** Are artists still needed, or can AI become a creative partner?\n",
       "    * **Style & Innovation:** How does AI influence artistic styles and generate novel creations?\n",
       "* **Brain Tech & AI:** This talk likely covers:\n",
       "    * **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs):** Exploring the potential and challenges of connecting minds to computers. \n",
       "    * **Memory Enhancement:**  Could AI improve memory or cognition?\n",
       "    * **Ethical Implications of Brain Tech:** Concerns around privacy, control, and potential misuse.\n",
       "* **Climate Change & Terraforming:** This talk suggests a focus on the intersection of AI and environmental concerns, with a speculative element.  Potential topics include:\n",
       "    * **AI-Driven Climate Modeling:** How AI can help predict and mitigate climate change.\n",
       "    * **Terraforming Concepts:** Exploring futuristic ideas like creating self-sustaining ecosystems on other planets.\n",
